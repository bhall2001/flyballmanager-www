## How do I handle 2 single day tournaments?

Flyball Manager is designed to manage a single tournament. When hosting 2 single day tournaments on back to back days, each day is set up as a tournament independent of each other.

Entries for the tournaments can be imported from a .csv file. This assists with the initial setup of the tournaments. For information on this file please refer to the Tournament entries section of this documentation.

Lanes for the second tournament day can be reversed. This is detailed in the scheduling section of this documentation.

## Norton is telling me that some files are unsafe and removes them.

This is a side effect of the app not being code signed and trusted. You will need to disable Norton in order to run the application. Head to the [Norton Support forums](https://support.norton.com/sp/en/us/norton-360/current/solutions/v15457075) to learn how to temporarily disable Norton. Follow instructions in the section labeled "Exclude disks, folders, and files from scans"

## How do I print the scoring table race sheets?

Flyball Manager replaces any handwritten forms the scoring table would have done in the past. Flyball Manager IS the source of truth for scoring tournaments. There is no need for the head table to do any manual scoring separate from Flyball Manager.

## The C.2 form always shows "3/5 Format" even for heats that are not 3 of 5

The NAFA form is a generic form that includes the text "3/5 Format" no matter what the heat format is. The NAFA form is available in the Appendix C of the [NAFA Rules of Racing](http://flyball.org/rules/rulebook.pdf).

## How do I import my schedule?

Flyball Manager does not allow importing of schedules. The application automatically generates the race schedule for you from the entries and divisions created for the tournament.

## Can I use Flyball Manager for a multi-ring tournament?

Well, yes and no. Flyball Manager at this time does not officially support multi-ring tournaments. However, Flyball Manager can handle scoring the tournament as if it was a single ring tournament. The paper C.2 forms would come back to the "Pit Boss" from each ring where they would be entered into the application. Flyball Manager can handle generating the seed chart, scheduling, printing of forms, reporting, scoring, placements and generating the NAFA scoring file all from a central location.

What Flyball Manager can't do at this time is have scoring systems at each ring entering in data for the races at the rings. The online side also does not support multi-ring tournaments. For this you would have to use Flyball Geek (for now).

My plan is to fully support multi-ring tournaments. At one point this was supported but there were some issues that needed to be ironed out. It is on my road map and will be added in.

If you have any questions on how to use Flyball Manager in a multi-ring tournament feel free to contact me directly. (bhall underscore 2001 at yahoo dot com -- sorry for the cryptic info, hopefully you can figure it out ;-)
