### Single Elimination Bracket (in development)

Click the `+ Single Elimination` button to enable a single elimination bracket for the division. Select the format for the heats of the bracket. Single elimination bracket formats are limited to 2 of 3 or 3 of 5 formats.

### 1 Race Bracket

This is a special bracket that should only be used for 1-day tournaments and divisions with 4 teams. Teams in these divisions will race 3 times with 1 round of round robin racing. This results in sub-optimal number of total heats for the division.
