# Online Results

Flyball Manager provides an integrated online website. The website is used by participants to stay updated on race status as tournaments progress.

## ondeckmanager.com

Flyball Manager is part of the ondeckmanager product family. Participants should be directed to [www.ondeckmanager.com](https://www.ondeckmanager.com) to find tournament information.

The online website provides realtime updates of the tournament schedule showing what race is "Racing", "On deck" and "In the hole". If you are familiar with Flyball Geek it's a similiar concept -- well except that it's totally integrated into the scoring process. Once a network connection is established, scoring a tournament will automatically update the on deck status.

## Enable ondeckmanager.com

Online integration is not enabled by default. The integration **REQUIRES** a good, reliable wifi connection. If the device running Flyball Manager looses it's network connection to ondeckmanager.com realtime updates will stop.

When the tournament date is close feel free to turn on the integration. To see the online schedule you must have generated a schedule.
