# Embracing the Future: Why Flyball Tournaments Should Transition to Online Results

In October 2024, the North American Flyball Association’s CanAm International Flyball Classic embraced a significant shift in how heat results were communicated. Rather than printing labels for teams to validate their results, participants were directed to view near real-time results online. This change not only aligned with modern practices but also highlighted the potential for enhancing the tournament experience.

For many years, <!-- truncate -->Flyball Manager has supported online results, accessible through the Ondeck Manager website. While printed labels have been a staple for score validation, the shift to online results represents a step forward in efficiency, sustainability, and accessibility. Here’s why it’s time to make this change permanent.

## 1. Efficiency and Real-Time Updates

Printed labels require physical distribution, manual handling, and potential reprints in the event of errors. Online results, by contrast, are updated almost instantly as racing progresses. This near real-time access eliminates delays and ensures participants always have the latest information at their fingertips. Teams can verify scores directly from their devices, whether they’re at the tournament venue or checking remotely.

## 2. Environmental Impact

The environmental benefits of reducing printed materials cannot be overstated. Each label printed adds to the waste generated during tournaments. Transitioning to an online system significantly reduces paper and ink consumption, aligning with broader sustainability goals and reducing the tournament’s environmental footprint.

## 3. Accessibility for All

Online results are accessible to anyone with an internet connection, providing teams, officials, and spectators with a unified platform to view scores. By centralizing information on a website like Ondeck Manager, participants no longer need to rely on physical labels or specific locations to validate results.

## 4. Cost Savings

Printing labels incurs costs for paper, ink, and maintenance of printing equipment. Over the course of multiple tournaments, these costs can add up significantly. Online results eliminate these expenses, freeing up resources that can be redirected to other aspects of tournament operations.

## 5. Enhanced User Experience

An online system provides opportunities for additional features such as historical score tracking, filtering results by teams or divisions, and integrating other tournament data. These enhancements enrich the user experience, making the event more engaging and interactive for participants.

## A Proven System

The success of online results at CanAm 2024 demonstrated the feasibility and advantages of this approach. Flyball Manager and Ondeck Manager are already equipped to support this transition seamlessly. These platforms have been refined over years of use, ensuring reliability and ease of access.

## Moving Forward

As we continue to evolve the sport of flyball, embracing technology is a natural progression. The transition to online results is more than a convenience; it’s an opportunity to modernize tournament operations, improve sustainability, and provide a better experience for all involved.

We encourage tournament organizers and participants to fully adopt online results and make printed labels a thing of the past. The tools are already in place, and the benefits are clear. Let’s move forward together into a more efficient, eco-friendly, and connected future for flyball.
