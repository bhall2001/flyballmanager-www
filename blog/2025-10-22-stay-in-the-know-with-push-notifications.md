# Never Miss Your Race Again: Introducing Push Notifications

One of the most requested features for OnDeck Manager has arrived: push notifications. Now you can receive instant alerts when teams you're tracking are called to the hole, ensuring you never miss a race.

This feature integrates seamlessly with our new Digital Dance Cards, allowing you to stay informed whether you're at the tournament venue, grabbing lunch, or taking a quick break. Your device will notify you exactly when you need to start heading back to the ring.

## How Push Notifications Work

Push notifications are automatically enabled when you add clubs or teams to your Digital Dance Card on ondeckmanager.com. Here's what happens:

1. Visit [ondeckmanager.com](https://ondeckmanager.com) and navigate to the tournament schedule

Notifications work across all your devices—phones, tablets, laptops, and even smart watches—as long as you have enabled notifications.

## What About iOS Devices?

iOS devices (iPhone and iPad) require special setup for web push notifications due to Apple's system requirements. The process is more involved than other platforms and includes additional configuration steps.

We've created a comprehensive guide specifically for iOS users. Please see our dedicated article: **"Setting Up Push Notifications on iOS Devices"** (coming soon) for detailed instructions.

## Managing Your Notifications

Once notifications are enabled, you have full control over which races you're alerted about:

**Customizing Your Dance Card:**

- Add or remove clubs and teams at any time
- Notifications automatically update based on your current Dance Card
- You'll only receive alerts for teams currently on your list

**Disabling Notifications:**
If you need to temporarily disable notifications:

- Use your device's Do Not Disturb mode, or
- Remove all teams from your Dance Card, or
- Adjust notification permissions in your browser settings

## Privacy and Data

Your notification preferences are stored locally and used only to deliver race alerts. We don't track notification data or use it for any other purpose. You can disable notifications at any time through your browser or device settings.

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Keep your browser or app open:** Notifications work best when your browser tab or app is open, though many browsers will deliver notifications even when closed
2. **Check your connection:** Ensure you have a stable internet connection at the tournament venue
3. **Test it out:** Add a team to your Dance Card before your first race to confirm notifications are working
4. **Multiple devices:** Enable notifications on all your devices for maximum flexibility

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Not receiving notifications?**

- Verify the permission prompt was accepted
- Check your browser's notification settings
- Ensure your device's Do Not Disturb mode is off or configured correctly
- Confirm you have teams added to your Dance Card
- Try refreshing the ondeckmanager.com page

**Notifications arriving late?**

- Check your internet connection strength
- Close unused browser tabs to improve performance
- Restart your browser if notifications seem delayed

**Too many notifications?**

- Refine your Dance Card to include only your primary teams
