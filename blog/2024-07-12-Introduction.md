Today version 6.0.0 of Flyball Manager has been released. This version is a complete re-write of the scheduling engine. I would like to thank Dale Smith for sharing his algorithm with me to make the Flyball Manager scheduling engine better.

There are numerous other UI enhancments and bug fixes. All in all if you have used a previous version of Flyball Manager you will find yourself right at home with this new version.
