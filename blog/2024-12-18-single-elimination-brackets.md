# Exciting Update: Flyball Manager Now Supports Single Elimination Brackets!

It’s been a long time in the making, but I’m thrilled to announce that **Flyball Manager** now includes support for single elimination brackets!

This journey started back in 2020 with a major project: completely re-writing the database layer. That foundational work set the stage for everything that followed,<!-- truncate --> including a critical update to the scheduling engine.

## Why Update the Scheduling Engine?

The feedback from users like you was clear—there was room for improvement in the schedules Flyball Manager was generating. So, I set out to overhaul the scheduling engine with two key goals:

1. Integrate **Dale Smith’s proven NAFA scheduling logic**.
2. Build in the flexibility needed to support bracket racing.

With these two pillars in place, the groundwork was finally ready for brackets.

## Introducing Bracket Racing

The first step toward brackets was introducing **1-race brackets for single-day tournaments**, which launched a couple of years ago. That feature was a proof of concept—it showed the app could handle the unique needs of bracket racing.

Now, I’ve taken the next big step: implementing **single elimination brackets with loser races**. Achieving this required fine-tuning the scheduling engine, updating the user interface, and extending functionality on **OnDeckManager.com** to fully support bracket racing.

## Designed for Ease of Use

My goal with this update is to make single elimination brackets simple and intuitive. From scheduling to scoring and even communicating race details, **Flyball Manager handles it all**. I’ve worked hard to ensure the experience feels smooth and straightforward, so you can focus on running your tournament.

## Your Feedback Is Key

If you’re hosting a tournament with bracket races, I’d love to hear from you. While I’ve tested the feature extensively, real-world use is where we uncover the unexpected. If you run into any issues, please don’t hesitate to reach out—I’ll do everything I can to address them quickly.

Thank you for your continued support of Flyball Manager. There are more exciting updates on the way, so stay tuned!

**Happy Racing!**
